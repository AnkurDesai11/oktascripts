#Instructions

All scripts are multithreaded and the python process may have to teerminated using task manager to stop the script while its running

As the script is multithreaded, please check the output file (incomplete) to get the total number of ids processed and accordingly enter the id at that position from the input file if you wish to continue from that point

DO NOT - enter the last id from the incomplte output file as this may not be necessarily the last processed record (due to multithreading)

EG - if the output file has 125 records processed, enter the 125th id as the 'user id to continue from' optional parameter
